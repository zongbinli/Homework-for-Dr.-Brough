#Read the paper _What Should Economists Do?_ by James M. Buchanan.
* His main point is most of the economists are concentrate on the scarce resouces, find the equilibrium,  and distribution. Buchanan think economist think they should foucus on a particular form of human activity, and upon the various institutional arrangements that arise as a result of this form of activity.

* The word "catallatics" means finding the relationship between human activities, and use computational method to solve the problems.

* According to Buchanan, most economists are focusing on allocation scarce resouces problem.

* Buchanan thinks economists should focus on the relationship between human activity and end the maximization problem by using the social welfare function. Then economists should use computational methodology to solve the problem. 






# Introduction

After reading Buchanan's paper about "What should economist do @Buchanan1979, I would like to address the problem of What should computational economist do. Adding computational methodology into economist is the core trend to the viability and the efficiency of economic model. I want to bring up Elinor Ostrom's methodology @boettke2013riding in its research, on the ground and field study, which I believe has significant meaning to computational economic. On the ground and field study methodology should be implemented into computational economic.



# brief literature review

*In Buchanan's paper, he brough up the idea of we could end the utility maximization problem with social walfare problem, and turned everything into computational problem, which, personally, means quantify the economic problem @Buchanan1979. It provided us a method to come up with the viable economic model in high efficiency. 

*In Peter Boettke's paper, it presented Elinor Ostrom's adventure and Ostrom's On the ground field study methodology @boettke2013riding. It is the methodology I want to implement into what should computational economist do. 

*In Donald's paper, he studied deeply the relationship between consumer shopping behavior and price perception @lichtenstein1993price. It is a great field study example of what Buchanan's relationship between human activity. 

*In Robert's paper, he described how applied similar on the ground research method into macroeconomic problem @king1999should.


# Brief outline of proposal 

*Brief summary of literature review

*What computational economist is doing.

*Benefit of methodology of on the ground and field study 
    + define on the ground and field study 
    + application of on the ground and field study 

*How to apply on the ground and field study into computational economist and why it is meaningful.
    + personally, shortage of traditional computational economis 
    + how on the ground research and field study could improve it 

*Brief example

*Conclusion
